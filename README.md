# wifi-wardriving
This project provides a bash script for wardriving with a Raspberry Pi 5 or laptop, G-Mouse VK-162 GPS module, and a wireless adapter. It captures WiFi network data with airodump-ng, logs GPS coordinates, and converts them to GPX format for use with tools like WiGLE and Google Earth.
