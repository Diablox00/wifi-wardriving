# Wifi Wardriving

This project provides a Bash script for wardriving with a **Raspberry Pi 5** or **laptop**, a **G‑Mouse VK‑162 GPS module**, and a **wireless adapter**. It captures WiFi network data with **airodump-ng**, logs GPS coordinates via **gpsd**, and converts them into **KML** format for use with mapping tools such as **Google Earth**.

## 🚗 Features

- **GPS Logging**: Captures GPS data from a connected GPS device using `gpsd`.
- **Monitor Mode**: Puts the wireless interface into monitor mode to sniff WiFi networks.
- **Automated Capture**: Records WiFi networks alongside GPS coordinates.
- **KML Conversion**: Converts GPS logs into **KML** format for easy visualization in **Google Earth**.

## 📦 Requirements

Tested on **Kali Linux** (or any Debian-based distribution) running on a **Raspberry Pi 5** or a **laptop**. You will need:

- **GPS Module** (e.g., G‑Mouse VK‑162) connected via USB  
- **Wireless Adapter** that supports monitor mode (e.g., Alfa AWUS036ACH)  
- **aircrack-ng** suite (`airodump-ng`)  
- **gpsd** and **gpsd-clients** for GPS handling  
- **python** for KML generation and GPS log parsing  

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Diablox00/wifi-wardriving.git
   cd wifi-wardriving
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   sudo bash install.sh
   ```

3. **Configure the script**: Open `wardrive.sh` in your preferred editor and set:
   - `GPS_DEV` (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0`)
   - `WIRELESS_IFACE` (e.g., `wlan1`)
   - `CAPTURE_PREFIX` (e.g., `wardrive_capture`)

   You can edit these variables using a text editor (e.g., `nano wardrive.sh`).
   
## 📝 Usage

Run the script with superuser privileges:

```bash
sudo bash wardrive.sh
```

The script will:
1. Stop any running `gpsd` service.
2. Start `gpsd` on the specified `GPS_DEV`.
3. Wait for a GPS fix.
4. Enable monitor mode on the wireless interface.
5. Launch `airodump-ng` to capture WiFi data with GPS logging.
6. Convert the GPS logs into KML format for use with **Google Earth**.
7. Clean up and restore network settings.

### 📁 Output Files

- `wardrive_capture-01.cap` — Captured packet dump
- `wardrive_capture-01.csv` — CSV summary of detected networks
- `wardrive_capture-01.gps` — Raw GPS log (NMEA)
- `output.kml` — KML format file for use in **Google Earth** and other mapping tools

## 🌐 Upload to Google Earth

Visualize your route by opening the KML file in **Google Earth**:

1. Open **Google Earth** (either the desktop or web version).
2. Click on the "File" menu and select "Open."
3. Choose the `output.kml` file generated by the script.
4. View your wardriving path and network data on the map.
